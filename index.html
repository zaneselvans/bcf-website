      <p>
        We are a member owned and operated bulk-food buying cooperative in Boulder, Colorado.
        We aim to give our members affordable access to simple, high quality food.
        We operate at cost, and keep costs low by doing the work ourselves and buying directly from producers and wholesalers.
        Our suppliers include <a href="http://www.goldenorganics.org/" target="_blank">Golden Organics</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiercoop.com/" target="_blank">Frontier Co-op</a>, <a href="https://m.costco.com/warehouse-locations/superior-co-480.html" target="_blank">Costco</a>, <a href="http://equalexchange.coop/" target="_blank">Equal Exchange</a>, and <a href="http://www.consciouscoffees.com/" target="_blank">Conscious Coffees</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Our prices are 30-50% lower than Boulder grocery stores (based on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Gbgs2l27gKyCGMkiag2jQJ9GdQjk432v0YCVDNbHZk">2018 price comparison</a>).</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Membership</h4>
      <p>
        We are democratically governed by our members, and all members share in the economic benefits of the cooperative.
        Individual members pay a $25 equity share and institutional members pay a $250 equity share (refundable if you later choose to leave).
        This money supports our operations and allows us to place orders without relying on credit.
        While non-members can make purchases, they pay higher prices and cannot vote in elections.
      </p>
      <h4>Logistics</h4>
      <p>
        We coordinate orders via an online platform and require electronic prepayment.
        Orders are placed every 2 to 8 weeks, depending on the supplier, and delivered to a central location where volunteers receive and sort the products.
        Everyone is then invited to pick up their orders during designated pickup times.
      </p>

            <div>
              I grew up in Northwest Missouri &mdash; in a small town surrounded by corn fields and caves &mdash; where my first job (at age 8) was picking up cow patties for 50 cents a bucket.
              I went on to receive a BS in Biology from Truman State University and a MS in Entomology and Chemical Ecology from the University of North Dakota.
              I have had a variety of occupations from studying feral hogs, saving sea turtles in Florida, to blacksmithing in the Appalachia.
              I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying insects and working to understand the future of pollinator health, food production, and food security.
              I currently serve on the board as president and actively learning how to make yogurt.

              I live at Wild Sage Cohousing, where I'm a stay-at-home parent, community treasurer, and landscaping team lead.
              I joined BCF in 2016 to support my bread-baking habit, and somehow got talked into doing the bookkeeping.
              BCF, in turn, became a gateway to housing advocacy and local politics.
              I'm on the board of the Boulder Housing Coalition and the leadership team of Boulder Progressives, and write a regular column for the Boulder Daily Camera.
              Hiking, biking, climbing, and running keep me 'grounded'.

          <a href="https://foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/user_settings" target="_blank">foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/user_settings</a>.
          Name, phone, and email should be updated as needed to always point to an appropriate contact person.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Configure payments</h4>
          The cooperative uses <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> to accept payments from both debit/credit cards (2.9% + $0.30 fee) and bank accounts (0.8% fee, $5 max).
          We suggest paying by bank account to avoid the high credit card fees.
          Add a bank account to your Foodclub account at <a href="https://foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/bank_accounts" target="_blank">foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/bank_accounts</a>, then follow the directions to verify the bank account using microdeposits (takes 2-3 business days).
          You can make manual payments or activate automatic payments at <a href="https://foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/make_payment" target="_blank">foodclub.org/bouldercoopfood/make_payment</a>.
          Since failure to prepay for your order results in your removal from the order, we <i>strongly encourage</i> activating automatic payments (with option "Auto-pay any negative balance").
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Place orders</h4>
          To search for and add items to your order, select a supplier ("Select source") and click "Order", or use the global "Product search".
          The listed prices do not include markup (22% for members, 32% for non-members) and sales tax (3.86% for food, 8.845% for non-food).
          The order cycle proceeds as follows:
          <br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>Place your order by the deadline.</li>
            <li>
              Either enable automatic payments or ensure your prepaid balance is equal to (or larger than) your shopping cart total.
              Both numbers are displayed at the top of the page.
            </li>
            <li>On the deadline, the order locks automatically.</li>
            <li>
              An admin generates invoices (only then are they visible to users), triggers prepayments ("pending charges"), and drops users with insufficient balances (and without automatic payments enabled).
            </li>
            <li>An admin submits the orders to our suppliers.</li>
            <li>
              Once the items are delivered and our suppliers paid, an admin finalizes the invoices and archives the orders.
              Sales tax and any price changes or out-of-stock items are automatically applied to user balances.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Buy member equity shares</h4>
          Individual / household membership requires a (refundable) $25 equity share per adult (16+ years old) in a household.
          If you choose to buy these in installments, please email <a href="mailto:board@bouldercooperativefood.org">board@bouldercooperativefood.org</a> with your target number so that we know when to consider you a member.
          Institutional membership requires a flat (refundable) $250 equity share.
          You can add shares to your order at <a href="https://foodclub.org/bcf_internal/order_form" target="_blank">foodclub.org/bcf_internal/order_form</a>.
          Members pay a lower markup (22%) than non-members (32%).
